            <div class="row gx-4 gx-lg-5 justify-content-center">

                    <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single
                        sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions
                        eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal
                        earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly
                        round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

                    <h4>Aggressive Weight Cuts in Main Events.</h4>
                    <p>Main events can last for five long rounds for some fighters. Athletes who cut too much weight
                        often find themselves in tough grappling or wrestling contests and quickly become fatigued.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This
                        could be the game plan of their opponent, who knows that if they drag their opponent into rounds
                        four and five, they can easily take the fight away from them by tiring their bigger opponent
                        out.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Motherhood and Fighting.</h4>
                    <p>Female fighters with children might find it very difficult to balance their personal and
                        professional
                        lives. While their bodies may recover easily, the mental strain can be challenging</p>
                    <!-- <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of
                        tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet
                        far too little for the next ten.</blockquote> -->
                    <h4>Knockout Losses and Weak Chins</h4>
                    <p>Suffering several KO losses can lead to a weak chin. Many fighters develop what is known as a
                        "glass chin" and can only take one or two good shots before crumbling to the canvas. All the
                        damage from their previous bouts adds up over time, and these injuries can affect a fighter's
                        performance. Usually, fighters who have been in some wars (wild fights or fighting recklessly)
                        tend to fall into this category.</p>
                    <!-- <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="..." /></a> -->

                    <h4>Biased Judges</h4>
                    <p>
                        Judges in certain cities, such as Las Vegas, may have biases compared to judges from other
                        countries or commissions. Whenever a fight goes to decision in Vegas, be prepared for a
                        potentially controversial outcome. Two different judges may interpret the same fight in
                        different ways, leading to accusations of robbery. Keep an eye on judges with a history of
                        scoring matchups incorrectly under the current point system, as their names often come up in
                        news articles.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Bad Referees</h4>
                    <p>
                        Organizations typically have their own staple referees, but sometimes a new and inexperienced
                        referee is assigned to a match. Unfortunately, as a punter, you may not know who the referee
                        will be for a specific match. Some referees may make mistakes, such as stopping a fight too
                        early, which is out of your control. Keep an eye out for referees with a history of bad
                        decisions and tread lightly if you know they will be the referee for the match you bet on.
                        Additionally, different commissions have their own sets of referees, so you may see an
                        unfamiliar referee in a different state or country.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Weight Cuts</h4>
                    <p>Bad weight cuts often lead to poor performances on fight night. They can result from illness or
                        bad dieting, and if a fighter misses weight or struggles to make weight in the weeks leading up
                        to a bout, it could potentially put the bout in danger of being called off. Look out for
                        fighters with a history of bad weight cuts, as they tend not to perform as well in their bouts.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Overweight</h4>
                    <p>
                        Some fighters receive hefty penalties for being overweight, which usually results in them losing
                        a portion of their purse. This fact can put extra mental pressure on a fighter and give extra
                        motivation to their opponent going into a fight. Being significantly overweight is seen as
                        unprofessional, and fights may be made into catchweight bouts or canceled altogether.
                    </p>
