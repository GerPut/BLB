                        <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single
                            sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions
                            eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an
                            equal
                            earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly
                            round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

                        <h4>Aggressive Weight Cuts in Main Events.</h4>
                        <p>Main events can last for five long rounds for some fighters. Athletes who cut too much weight
                            often find themselves in tough grappling or wrestling contests and quickly become fatigued.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This
                            could be the game plan of their opponent, who knows that if they drag their opponent into
                            rounds
                            four and five, they can easily take the fight away from them by tiring their bigger opponent
                            out.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Motherhood and Fighting.</h4>
                        <p>Female fighters with children might find it very difficult to balance their personal and
                            professional
                            lives. While their bodies may recover easily, the mental strain can be challenging</p>
                        <!-- <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of
                            tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet
                            far too little for the next ten.</blockquote> -->
                        <h4>Knockout Losses and Weak Chins</h4>
                        <p>Suffering several KO losses can lead to a weak chin. Many fighters develop what is known as a
                            "glass chin" and can only take one or two good shots before crumbling to the canvas. All the
                            damage from their previous bouts adds up over time, and these injuries can affect a
                            fighter's
                            performance. Usually, fighters who have been in some wars (wild fights or fighting
                            recklessly)
                            tend to fall into this category.</p>

                        <h4>Biased Judges</h4>
                        <p>
                            Judges in certain cities, such as Las Vegas, may have biases compared to judges from other
                            countries or commissions. Whenever a fight goes to decision in Vegas, be prepared for a
                            potentially controversial outcome. Two different judges may interpret the same fight in
                            different ways, leading to accusations of robbery. Keep an eye on judges with a history of
                            scoring matchups incorrectly under the current point system, as their names often come up in
                            news articles.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Bad Referees</h4>
                        <p>
                            Organizations typically have their own staple referees, but sometimes a new and
                            inexperienced
                            referee is assigned to a match. Unfortunately, as a punter, you may not know who the referee
                            will be for a specific match. Some referees may make mistakes, such as stopping a fight too
                            early, which is out of your control. Keep an eye out for referees with a history of bad
                            decisions and tread lightly if you know they will be the referee for the match you bet on.
                            Additionally, different commissions have their own sets of referees, so you may see an
                            unfamiliar referee in a different state or country.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Weight Cuts</h4>
                        <p>Bad weight cuts often lead to poor performances on fight night. They can result from illness
                            or
                            bad dieting, and if a fighter misses weight or struggles to make weight in the weeks leading
                            up
                            to a bout, it could potentially put the bout in danger of being called off. Look out for
                            fighters with a history of bad weight cuts, as they tend not to perform as well in their
                            bouts.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Overweight</h4>
                        <p>
                            Some fighters receive hefty penalties for being overweight, which usually results in them
                            losing
                            a portion of their purse. This fact can put extra mental pressure on a fighter and give
                            extra
                            motivation to their opponent going into a fight. Being significantly overweight is seen as
                            unprofessional, and fights may be made into catchweight bouts or canceled altogether.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Bulky fighters</h4>
                        <p>Muscular fighters and their gas tanks (cardio) don't last in later rounds. Big muscles
                            require
                            more blood, which in turn needs more oxygen to carry to different parts of the body. Keep an
                            eye
                            out for these types of fighters. Usually, a grueling weight cut with not enough time to
                            recover
                            leads to a poor performance. These type of fighters tend to perform well for only one round
                            but
                            in later rounds, their cardio lets them down, and fatigue takes over</p>
                        <h4>Injuries</h4>
                        <p>
                            Undisclosed injuries that are only revealed after the fight can significantly affect a
                            fighter's
                            performance. Unfortunately, you won't know what injury a fighter has because it is kept
                            secret.
                            Pay close attention to when fighters undergo surgery and how quickly they return to the
                            octagon.
                            Returning too soon might not be a good thing. Make notes of when a fighter gets injured,
                            write
                            down any updates, and note how long they have been off. Fighting too soon might not be the
                            best
                            idea, especially if the fighter is in the later stages of their career.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Suspension</h4>
                        <p>
                            Suspended fighters and time off can affect their performance in the octagon. Some fighters
                            are
                            just not the same as they used to be after a long layoff. Whether the suspension was
                            drug-related or injury-related, keep an eye on how quickly or slowly the fighter makes a
                            comeback and who they are making a comeback against.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Short Notice</h4>
                        <p>
                            Fighters who take fights on short notice or stand in for injured fighters might have a
                            disadvantage because they don't have a full fight camp to get into optimal shape for the
                            fight.
                            Look closely at the odds for fighters who stand in. Usually, they will be lower-ranked
                            fighters
                            or new fighters to the organization trying to prove themselves.With higher ranked opponents
                            that
                            stand in to fight be extra careful when considering to bet on them.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Young Fighters</h4>
                        <p>
                            Young fighters who stay active and fight regularly without taking too much damage tend to
                            have a
                            longer career. They build experience and often change weight classes. These types of
                            fighters
                            are usually tough matchups for newcomers and often surprise when stepping in as replacement
                            fighters on short notice or in main events.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Turbulent Events</h4>
                        <p>Every now and then, events leading up to a fight cause major changes in how things were
                            planned.
                            Some press conferences get canceled, and some lose their main events due to bad weight cuts.
                            When there is a major reshuffle between fighters and their opponents on a card, be cautious
                            when
                            betting because bookmakers scramble to make accurate lines.</p>
                        <h4>Social Media</h4>
                        <p>
                            Follow fighters on Instagram and see what they post. Here and there, valuable information
                            might
                            be dropped, or they might say something that could sway your bet to the other side.
                            Sometimes
                            their managers drop info that was not suppose to be leaked.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Wrestling</h4>
                        <p>
                            Wrestling is a great skill advantage to have, and usually, with wrestling, comes great
                            cardio.
                            Controlling the fight on the ground and making your opponent tired with relentless pressure
                            breaks a fighter's will. Usually, fighters and fans get frustrated, but winning is winning,
                            no
                            matter what the game plan is. Some of the best champions always have well-rounded wrestling
                            skills in their arsenal.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Submission Artists</h4>
                        <p>
                            A great set of jiu-jitsu skills, just like wrestling, is invaluable to a fighter. Early
                            rounds,
                            where sweat does not play a big factor in getting out of submissions, are advantageous to
                            fighters who don't mind fighting off their backs or going for an early submission. Look out
                            for
                            fighters with a great grappling history and, more importantly, how they match up with
                            opponents.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Cardio</h4>
                        <p>
                            The cornerstone of a great fighter is cardio. The better the fighter's cardio, the longer
                            they
                            last inside the cage. Fighters who have fought championship level with five rounds know that
                            cardio sometimes gets you the win in the later rounds if the other fighter doesn't have the
                            experience of fighting five rounds. Look out for fighters with a strong winning record and
                            who
                            have also fought in rounds three to five.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Switch Stance</h4>
                        <p>Fighters who have the ability to fight in both southpaw and orthodox stances tend to be more
                            unpredictable. Look out for these types of fighters, as they impose a guessing game on their
                            opponents and can catch them with sneaky strikes that add up in the later rounds.</p>
                        <h4>Karate Stance</h4>
                        <p>Karate stance fighters, also known as point strikers, are tricky to fight against. They are
                            very
                            good at keeping their distance and outscoring their opponents. Opponents tend to get
                            frustrated
                            and deviate from their game plan, which can lead to getting caught and ending the fight.
                            However, these fighters can struggle when taken down and fighting from the ground.
                            Additionally,
                            a weak point of this stance is the exposure of the front leg to leg kicks. The more damage
                            the
                            front leg takes from effective front kicks, the less mobility the fighter will have, and
                            switching their stance may not be optimal.</p>
                        <h4>Competition Level</h4>
                        <p>The level of competition inside training camps and gyms is important. Fighters often become a
                            product of their environment. Look at who the fighter is training with and how they fare in
                            the
                            UFC. Some gyms are known for producing absolute monsters, so keep an eye out for fighters
                            who
                            are coming out of very successful gyms.</p>
                        <h4>Analysts, Punters, Gurus, and Experts</h4>
                        <p>Follow other analysts and listen to what they have to say, but ultimately, stick with your
                            own
                            decisions and analysis. Two key lessons to learn from following other punters' advice or
                            information are that overconfident picks cannot always be considered truthful information,
                            and
                            sometimes, when someone's overconfident picks do become true (especially parlays), the
                            punter is
                            mistaken for an expert. Be aware of punters who are affiliated with bookies.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Records</h4>
                        <p>
                            Padded records might make a fighter look great, but it's important to consider the level of
                            competition they faced in previous organizations. If a new prospect is making their debut,
                            check
                            the level of competition they fought previously. Add their 5-10 previous opponents' wins
                            together and do the same with their losses. Divide the wins by the total fights and see how
                            successful all of them were. This is just a general gauge for you to see how strong previous
                            competitors were. Fight records are important, but don't get fooled by them.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Contracts</h4>
                        <p>Fighters under pressure after a certain amount of losses usually get matched up with fighters
                            in
                            a similar situation. You can expect a banger of a fight because there is so much at stake
                            for
                            both fighters</p>
                        <h4>Coaches</h4>
                        <p>
                            The biggest downfall of a fighter can be their coach and what they believe. Stubborn,
                            one-dimensional, or yes-men coaches have detrimental consequences for many fighters' careers
                            before they realize it's too late.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Fight IQ</h4>
                        <p>Fighter IQ is something to take note of when fighters compete. Some have the opportunity or
                            multiple opportunities to end a fight but end up losing. Take note of what commentators are
                            saying. Sometimes it's obvious to see a fighter is making the wrong decisions by not
                            listening
                            to their coach's advice or not changing their game plan.</p>
                        <h4>Hype</h4>
                        <p>Overhyped fighters can cause the betting lines of the favorite not to move much, making it a
                            good
                            time to bet on the favorite. Additionally, popular athletes with large fan bases can
                            contribute
                            to the hype of a fighter, making them seem better than their true skills. This can happen
                            when a
                            new fighter fights only once and immediately gets a title shot.</p>
                        <h4>Inactivity</h4>
                        <p>Extended periods of inactivity can cause fighters to fall behind in the sport's evolution.
                            Many
                            fighters step away for two years or more for various reasons, but the sport continues to
                            progress, and athletes become better and better. When a fighter returns, they may struggle
                            to
                            keep up with the evolving skills of their competitors.</p>
                        <h4>Retirement</h4>
                        <p>Fighters who retire and then decide to return may not be making the best decision. Although
                            some
                            fighters continue training, it's impossible to accurately predict what level they'll be when
                            facing high-level competition again. Age also plays a role, and failing to keep up with the
                            younger generation can be a significant mistake for fighters.</p>
                        <h4>Age</h4>
                        <p>Younger fighters tend to perform better than older fighters if the age gap is 5 years or more
                            between the two athletes. Younger fighters are more hungry; they want to prove a point,
                            climb
                            the ranks, and recover quicker from injuries. They also have more fighting years ahead of
                            them.
                            Older fighters have experience on their side, but if an older fighter misses weight or their
                            weight cut does not go well, or they have been inactive for a long period of time, the odds
                            might favor the younger fighter. Fighter age and record are probably the most important
                            factors
                            to consider when choosing a winner. Fighters between the ages of 25 to early 30s tend to be
                            in
                            their prime.</p>
                        <h4>Experience</h4>
                        <p>A solid winning fight record with an active fighter is a solid foundation to look at. An
                            athlete
                            with at least two fights a year or more is an active fighter. Some fighters learn from past
                            experiences and adapt their fighting styles accordingly or adjust to a different style
                            depending
                            on their opponent. It is essential to know what kind of style a fighter uses to compete.</p>
                        <h4>Fighting Style</h4>
                        <p>Matchmakers are excellent at pairing up fighters with similar styles and records, making it
                            hard
                            for punters to select a winner. Sometimes there are exceptions when wrestlers are matched
                            against strikers. This is an important factor to keep in mind, and stats like take-down
                            defensive and accuracy play a significant role. If fighters like to strike, don't be
                            surprised
                            if one comes up with a more wrestling plan during a fight. Take-downs can easily win a round
                            for
                            the more active fighter during a fight. Grapplers tend not to engage in striking contests
                            but
                            rather grind out a win through wrestling and take-downs.</p>
                        <h4>How fights end</h4>
                        <p>When looking at prop bets, understanding how fighters win fights can be helpful. By analyzing
                            past events and how fighters have finished fights, you can gain an indication of how a fight
                            might end. Typically, fighters will utilize their strongest skill to finish the fight. For
                            example, heavyweight fighters often rely on striking to secure a quick knockout.</p>
                        <h4>Press conferences and weigh-ins:</h4>
                        <p>If possible, watch press conferences and weigh-ins and read the comment section. By doing so,
                            you
                            might pick up on something that others have noticed. Reading comments on these events can
                            also
                            provide an indication of the direction in which the public's money is flowing before a
                            fight.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Check bookmaker's odds well in advance:</h4>
                        <p>Always take note of the money lines on certain matchups and how they are moving.
                            Understanding
                            how odds work and who sets the lines is also important. If you have an idea, be quick to
                            place a
                            wager well in advance.</p>
                        <h4>Big favorites:</h4>
                        <p>Betting on heavy favorites is not always the best idea as they don't provide much value, and
                            upsets are always possible. It might not even be worth including them in a parlay,
                            especially in
                            the main and co-main events where huge upsets tend to happen.</p>
                        <h4>Optimal lines:</h4>
                        <p>Look for lines that are +100 or better, particularly when champions are the underdog or when
                            excellent fighters are on the wrong side of the line, as this provides a lot of value. This
                            means that you need to be well aware of who is fighting whom when fights are announced.</p>
                        <h4>Over-under in main events:</h4>
                        <p>In big occasions with 5 rounds per fight, better fighters more often than not go the
                            distance.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Women's fights:</h4>
                        <p>Predicting women's fights can be challenging due to their unpredictable performance and
                            fighting
                            styles. Conduct thorough research on past fights and opponents.</p>
                        <h4>Strikes absorbed per minute</h4>
                        <p>A fighter with poor defense or who fights recklessly might have a high stat of strikes
                            absorbed
                            per minute. Taking too much damage in a fight can sway the decision to the other fighter,
                            even
                            if the fighter had more control time in the fight. Look out for fighters with high numbers
                            in
                            this category as it usually means their defense is not strong enough, and against a seasoned
                            striker in later rounds, they fail to persist.</p>

                        <h4>Popularity and priorities</h4>
                        <p>The more popular a fighter becomes, the busier their life becomes. Monetary offers may cross
                            their career paths, and the financial benefits of these deals are often too good to pass up.
                            This causes fighters to lose focus and hunger for fighting, leading to difficulties with
                            up-and-coming fighters who want to take their spot or title. These fighters find it
                            challenging
                            to balance everything and have a hard time maintaining their position in the fighting
                            world."
                        </p>
                        <h4>Cancelled Fights</h4>
                        <p>If a fight is cancelled for any reason and you have placed a bet on it, don't feel obligated
                            to
                            place another bet on a different fight. Instead, it's better to keep your money and bet on
                            another day.</p>
                        <h4>Protected Fighters</h4>
                        <p>You can often identify a "protected fighter" when an organization views them as a cash cow
                            and
                            gives them "easy" fights to pad their record. Typically, over-hyped fighters fall into this
                            category as well, but they will eventually meet their match when they least expect it. Keep
                            track of each of their fights, where they fight, and you will notice a weak point somewhere.
                            Social media posts by fans can also reveal information about these types of fighters.</p>
                        <h4>Mis-matched Bouts</h4>
                        <p>Be cautious when betting on the odds for these types of fights. Usually, there is a
                            significant
                            age difference or experience deficit between fighters, but the odds do not reflect this. It
                            may
                            be tempting to place a bet, but bookies make these bets appear attractive.</p>
                        <h4>Events in Cities with High Elevation</h4>
                        <p>Pay attention to when athletes travel to these cities for their bouts. Some athletes arrive a
                            month early to acclimate to higher elevation areas. Higher elevations place extra strain on
                            an
                            individual's cardio. The more muscular a fighter is and the higher the elevation, the more
                            difficult it is for that athlete to push themselves, particularly in later rounds. Look out
                            for
                            fighters who travel on short notice and did a full camp at much lower elevations. They could
                            potentially be at a disadvantage.</p>
                        <h4>Your Notes</h4>
                        <p>Take notes during events and organize them. Many announcers drop useful information, and
                            interesting stats are shown on screen. Write them down next to a fighter's name. Also, jot
                            down
                            your own observations, such as if a fighter gasses easily, is a slow starter, lowers their
                            hands
                            too often, is a weak grappler, a sloppy striker, or is stressed.</p>
